# simple_build: Very Simple Build System for C++

Simple script for constructing simple C++ projects: you have to 
configure a file indicating the various options you want and 
that's all. 

  - Made in Node, with no dependencies: you can place the build.mjs 
  file in your C/C++ project and you are ready to go (if you have
  node installed on your machine, of course)
  - Multiplatform: as being developed in Node, you can run in 
  every platform Node can run. Even in apple computers
  - Paralell: the sources are compiled in paralell. The problem 
  here is that I do not have a control about the maximum paralell
  tasks to run, so in very big projects that could be a problem
  - Quick: it presupones that the language is C/C++ to leverage 
  many general configurations other multipurpose systems have


**Issues pending**

Not implemented nothing for the tests of the application.
